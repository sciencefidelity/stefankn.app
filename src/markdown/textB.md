As an unsuspecting 18-year-old student returning to college in a Poland that was being divided up into Russian and German territories, Stefan was arrested and sent to Siberia. At first he thought of the journey as an adventure. He described vividly in his autobiography the horrors of the train ride and *processing* which he and millions of innocent people were subjected to. Stefan soon learned to use his artistic abilities to stay alive. The Russians made good use of Stefan's talents and put him to work painting slogans, *Who does, not work does not eat*. For years after the war was over Stefan suffered nightmares and was unable to sleep. He painted out many of his haunting memories in attempt to exercise his mind, restless experimentation with different techniques and materials in attempt to express his feelings.
