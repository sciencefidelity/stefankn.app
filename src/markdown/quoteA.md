> “Since 1940, when we first met in a Russian prison, he was my best friend. I found him again in 1960 his exhibition at the Gunther Franke Gallery. For he for me he was the greatest painter with the biggest heart and the brightest eyes... which were so alive! No-one had colours like Stefan Knapp! No one ever put so much energy into his work!”
