Stefan was born on 11th July 1921 in Bilgoraj, south east Poland. Stefan's father Anthony, before his marriage to Julia Wnuk, had travelled extensively in the east and China, and had strong humanitarian and political views. Growing up in the little town, surrounded by rivers and forests provided idyllic and secure childhood memories that anchored and sustained Stefan all through his life, inspired by his surroundings he would *borrow* household paints and bits of old board to paint on. Nature, trees and the rivers of his childhood recur again and again in the structures and organic forms throughout Stefan's work, and he had a deep understanding and appreciation of the forms, rhythms, patterns and properties of the materials with which he is surrounded himself.
